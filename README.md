# remoteFiles.R

This repository contains a file that I use everywhere in R whenever I
want to download files from my remote server in R.

It is tailored to exactly my remote server API.  That is available at
jmarca/detector_files.

As with my couchUtils repo, now that I've split it into its own
repository, I am going to try to generalize this a bit more, and maybe
add tests...whatever that means for R.  In the meantime, feel free to
modify this code for your own needs, but don't expect it to work for
you out of the box as it currently contains a lot of project-specific
stuff.

# License


I guess the GPL v2 for now, as most of R is licensed like that.
